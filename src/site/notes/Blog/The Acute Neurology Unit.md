Recently I spent a week observing the care of patients admitted in a specialised tertiary neurology unit in Manchester. The reason for arranging this was purely selfish: to expose myself to atypical presentations as well as a short trial run of neurology to hopefully determine whether the specialty is for me. However by the end of the week, I found that I had also changed my perspective on inpatient medicine and my approach to learning. This brief reflection will cover my thoughts about the placement, changes I'm going to be making as a result and finally at the end a short section on how and whether to arrange something like this. 
##### Setting the scene

The Acute Neurology Unit in Salford Royal is a specialist ward dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of complex neurological disease. In essence, it covers everything except stroke (for which there is a dedicated centre). As a result, patients on the ward had a wide range of pathology from cerebral venous sinus thrombosis to autoimmune encephalitis. To respond to a wide case load, the unit is armed with a team of multiple subspecialist consultants, resident doctors, physician associates and specialist nurses. 

#### The experience

Each morning began with a comprehensive discussion of overnight changes and concerning patients in the staff room, followed by a ward round to visit and update patients on management plans. There were several cases with significant diagnostic uncertainty despite extensive testing and examination. I observed as the consultants approached these patients as not problems waiting to be solved but evolving narratives requiring patience and continued thinking. What struck me was the was their transparency to patients about uncertainty and the mental stamina required to continuously review and pore over available information. This transparency seemed to strengthen the doctor-patient alliance rather than jeopardise it. As medical students, we are often presented all the information in one fell swoop through single-best answer questions and OSCE stations. In reality, conditions can take years to manifest and antibody tests can take several weeks to come back from the lab. Information across hours, days, weeks and years were all integrated into characterising a complete picture. 

#### Learning opportunities

During my week, I learnt at a variety of levels: understanding, experience, practice and reflection. Daily ward rounds became impromptu teaching sessions (see [[Blog/Pimping Short Stories/The art of pimping\|The art of pimping]]), with consultants pausing to demonstrate examination techniques and explain pathophysiology. The nature of neurology demands precise definitions, distinguishing paresthesia from dysesthesia and separating seizure types. The neurological examination was particularly useful in characterising the extent of pathology. One particular case stands out, where assessment of visual acuity and optokinetic nystagmus can distinguish functional visual loss from optic neuritis in a patient with multiple sclerosis. The patient reported no perception of light in her left eye, but a pupillary light reflex and optokinetic nystagmus was present, proving that not all of the visual loss is a result of optic neuritis. Findings that seemed subtle on Monday would be revisited on Tuesday with fresh eyes and contextualised differently. 
#### Changes to my approach





#### Arranging similar attachments



#### Conclusion 

What began as a career exploration exercise evolved into a recalibration of my understanding of good medical practice and my approach to learning.
