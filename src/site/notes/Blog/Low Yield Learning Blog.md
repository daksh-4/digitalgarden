### Welcome

I joined medical school to learn how the human body works, just like many of my peers. The format of lecture and workshop learning in first year set a solid foundation for building clinical pathology on top of. However, as I roll through the years of clinical placements I am increasingly noticing that there are gaps in my foundation and my understanding of the underlying physiology. Certain isolated facts get drilled into our minds by question banks and Anki decks (like Salmonella being the predominant cause of osteomyelitis in a patient with sickle cell anaemia) without any explanation why. The extreme focus on high-yield content goes hand in hand with Pareto's law, with 80% of examined content being directly linked to 20% of the facts. This ultimately does improve performance in tests, but in doing so reduces acquisition of medical knowledge to a race of who can do the most practice questions. As students, we are responsible for our own learning and while I am guilty of studying in this way to rank in the top of my cohort, I felt unsatisfied with my learning. Additionally, I believe exam writers are catching onto this and incorporating questions that require multiple steps to reach the answer and demand a thorough understanding of pathophysiology, clinical presentations, epidemiology and current guidelines. 

 If you would like to study the high yield facts that will improve your performance in exams, I encourage you to use other resources. The low yield learning blog is part of a conscious effort to cultivate curiosity and reflective habits. I plan to document my experiences in compact essays, strictly free from generative AI.
