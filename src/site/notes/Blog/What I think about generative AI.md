I have quite a lukewarm take on this. I don't like to use it in personal reflective writing as I believe it can alter the natural direction of thoughts, taking them to the realm of standardised opinions. 

Great for coding, sketching out rough ideas, testing concepts. 

I see it as a tool to connect the dots for me when I know where the dots are. Not for drawing new dots and lines (yet?). 

(This is likely to change)
