[The art of pimping](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/377862) is a well described phenomenon by which senior medical consultants interrogate their juniors (medical students, resident doctors, even the poor secondary school work experience student) with a series of rapid fire questions. The phrase pimping is theorised to be a cognate of the german word "PÃ¼mpfrage" literally translated to 'rapid questions'. The topic of this line of questioning can range from metaphysics to Jimi Hendrix's discography and occasionally medicine. 

When done correctly, this has helped me vastly in my understanding of a topic. No matter how many times I read about spinal cord tracts, murmur pathologies and obscure biochemical pathways, nothing creates such vivid memories as being forced to improvise and challenge our own uncertainties. I feel this has allowed me to push past my comfort zone and solidify connections in my mind. The essays titled "Pimping Short Stories" are tales from times I have experienced such interrogation and found some actionable points to learn from it.
