The [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) is a research centre at UCL with the broad focus of the "mathematical foundations of adaptive intelligent behaviour", approaching this topic from multiple lenses (theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, statistics and many more). As a novice but enthusiastic reader of such topics I jumped at the chance to attend their 7-week bridging programme, designed to equip students with mathematical intuitions and skills required for postgraduate research in their domain. 

With a rigorous curriculum spanning calculus, linear algebra, probability, ordinary differential equations and Fourier analysis, I was envisioning all the interesting papers I'd be able to understand and abstract conversations this newfound knowledge would unlock. Whilst not entirely unfamiliar with complex mathematical topics at the secondary school level, I found my experiences in research to feel entirely alien. Sitting in a talk or discussion, I often felt myself following the threads linking concepts together but feeling like the lights had been turned off when the conversation veered anywhere mathematical. Similarly, it is difficult for me to communicate my ideas about quantitative findings or motivations behind choices with data analysis. Through the course I set out to find the missing pieces and set the foundations for further exploration of ideas in my research. 





Whilst the experience was one of the most academically challenging ventures I have undergone,
