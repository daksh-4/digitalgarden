The [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) is a research centre at UCL with the broad focus of the "mathematical foundations of adaptive intelligent behaviour", approaching this topic from multiple lenses (theoretical neuroscience, machine learning, statistics and many more). As a novice but enthusiastic reader of such topics I jumped at the chance to attend their 7-week bridging programme, designed to equip students with mathematical intuitions and skills required for postgraduate research in their domain. 

With a rigorous curriculum spanning calculus, linear algebra, probability, ordinary differential equations and Fourier analysis, I was envisioning all the interesting papers I'd be able to understand and abstract conversations this newfound knowledge would unlock. Whilst not entirely unfamiliar with complex mathematical topics, I found my experiences in research to feel entirely alien. Sitting in a talk or discussion, I often felt myself following the threads linking concepts together but feeling like the lights had been turned off when the conversation veered anywhere mathematical. Similarly, it is difficult for me to communicate my ideas about quantitative findings or motivations behind choices with data analysis. Through the course I set out to find the missing pieces and set the foundations for further exploration of ideas in my research. 

Fortunately, the answer was clear from the first day. We started with a exploration of proofs, including terminology and approaches for proving theorems and solutions. A great deal of focus was spent on the formalisation of ideas into standard premises that could be employed, no matter what the context was. It is simple to say that A equals B, but formalising what this actually means requires some unravelling. If you can show that A is a [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of B and B is a subset of A, then this is only possible if A and B are the same [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)). This set up the language with which we would be communicating our ideas, and as things became more complex and abstract, having these tools helped tremendously in simplifying problems. (Interestingly, this [dialect](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EcDQIS2NTiQ) began to bleed into the day to day speech between my coursemates).
