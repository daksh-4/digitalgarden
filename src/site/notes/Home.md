### Introduction

Welcome to 120/80, a space for me to discuss my experiences navigating the space of medicine and academia. I plan to tell stories of my interactions with seniors and peers as well as my own musings and reflections on navigating the constantly shifting healthcare environment. 
### Why create low yield learning?

I find tools such as Claude and ChatGPT vital in day to day assimilation of new information, but have started to feel a disconnect in my own ability to communicate a coherent line of reasoning. In an era of generative AI content, this website is a space for me to develop my writing skills. I would like this website to be a place of discussion, please reach out at ... I would greatly appreciate hearing any of your thoughts regarding my essays. 
### Pimping short stories?

[The art of pimping](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/377862) is a well described phenomenon by which senior medical consultants interrogate their juniors (medical students, resident doctors, even the poor secondary school work experience student) with a series of rapid fire questions. The phrase pimping is theorised to be a cognate of the german word "PÃ¼mpfrage" literally translated to 'rapid questions'. The topic of this line of questioning can range from metaphysics to Jimi Hendrix's discography and occasionally medicine. The essays under the folder "Pimping Short Stories" are tales from times I have experienced such interrogation and found some actionable points to learn from it. 

When done correctly, this has helped me vastly in my understanding of a topic. No matter how many times I read about spinal cord tracts, murmur pathologies and obscure biochemical pathways, nothing creates such vivid memories as being forced to improvise and challenge our own uncertainties. I feel this has allowed me to push past my comfort zone and solidify connections in my mind. The essays under the folder "Pimping Short Stories" are tales from times I have experienced such interrogation and found some actionable points to learn from it. 

I also plan to have other sections so keep an eye out, but this is what I am starting with.
