### Introduction

I am a third year medical student writing about my experiences navigating the space of medicine and academia. These essays are strictly AI free, from good quality texts and outstanding teachers I have had the good fortune of spending time with. 

This is a [digital garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) and I use Obsidian to edit it.
