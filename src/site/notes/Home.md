### Introduction

Welcome to low yield learning, a space for me to discuss my experiences navigating the space of medicine and academia. I plan to tell stories of my interactions with seniors and peers as well as my own musings and reflections on navigating the constantly shifting healthcare environment. 
### What is low yield learning?

I joined medical school to learn how the human body works, just like many of my peers. The format of lecture and workshop learning in first year set a solid foundation for building clinical pathology on top of. However, as I roll through the years of clinical placements I am increasingly noticing that there are gaps in my foundation and my understanding of the underlying physiology. Somewhere along the line, I was led astray by the "high-yieldification" of content. Certain isolated facts get drilled into our minds by question banks and anki decks (like Salmonella being the predominant cause of osteomyelitis in a patient with sickle cell anaemia) without any explanation why. The extreme focus on high-yield content goes hand in hand with Pareto's law, with 80% of examined content being directly linked to 20% of the facts. This ultimately does improve performance in tests, but in doing so reduces acquisition of medical knowledge to a race of who can do the most practice questions. As students, we are responsible for our own learning and while I am guilty of studying in this way to rank in the top of my cohort, I felt unsatisfied with my learning. Additionally, I believe exam writers are catching onto this and incorporating questions that require multiple steps to reach the answer and as such demand a thorough understanding of pathophysiology, clinical presentations, epidemiology and current guidelines. 

The low yield learning blog is a way for me to claw back some of the information I missed through my pass through the systems. If you would like to study the high yield facts that will improve your performance in exams, I encourage you to use other resources. However, if you, like me, would like to connect the dots in your mind, have a read through some of the essays. I aim to present this information in compact bites ideal for reading on the tube. These essays are strictly AI free, from good quality texts and outstanding teachers I have had the good fortune of spending time with. I would like to grow this into a community and place of discussion, please reach out at ...
