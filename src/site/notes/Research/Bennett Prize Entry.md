Understanding Trends in the Prescribing of Thrombolytic Agents throughout England: A Time Series Analysis

Using the new OpenPrescribing Hospitals platform from the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, I analysed data on medicines used in secondary care to reveal new insights. 

In the recent NICE guidance update on the management of acute ischaemic strokes in July 2024, tenecteplase was introduced as a safe, equivalent, cheaper and easier to use alternative to alteplase (the standard thrombolysis agent). The British and Irish Association of Stroke Physicians (BIASP) also recommended that "it is reasonable for Stroke Services to consider a complete switch from alteplase to tenecteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in both the conventional and extended time window to simplify treatment pathways and avoid potential dosing errors which may occur if both Alteplase and Tenecteplase were to be available". 

Despite backing from NICE and BIASP, we saw significant regional variation in the use of the new drug tenecteplase on the OpenPrescribing platform. Closer examination revealed the following findings:

Tenecteplase had almost no usage before the guidance update, however, after July 2024 there has been substantial variation in uptake amongst integrated care boards (ICBs), with some ICBs rapidly switching whilst others (particularly London-based ICBs) have lagged behind despite hosting clinical trials investigating tenecteplase’s suitability. In this report, we have outlined the implication of missed opportunities for both cost savings (approximately £384 per treatment) and improved access to thrombolytic treatment, highlighting the need for better understanding of implementation barriers in the National Health Service (NHS). We found a clear national shift towards tenecteplase adoption, with potential savings of ~£3 million during a 12 month period in drug costs only if all doses had been switched after the guidance update. Analysis of ICB-level data revealed that adoption speed was not driven by ICB size, existing thrombolysis rates, or stroke care pathways, but perhaps instead by distinct organisational capabilities and decision-making processes within each region.

This experiment proved to be an interesting window into organisational bureaucracy and the multitude of factors that influence the implementation of evidence based medicine.
