This short story has innocent origins. 

I have been lulled into a false sense of security by my revision of the cardiovascular system. In my notes it is first in the alphabetical list of subspecialties (I usually skip Biochemistry when studying for exams) and thus the area which I have covered the most times. Combine this with the fact that a great proportion of patients have some cardiac comorbidities, lead me to believe that I am comfortable with the common cardiac presentations. 

Myself and 3 other medical students were shadowing a cardiology consultant on an inpatient ward, when we were asked to examine a patient. It's my turn to examine, so I begin with my inspection with inspection of the patient and paraphernalia around the bed. All I see is an infusion pump, a bag of clothes and several plastic cups on the side table. I continue with the hands, nails, capillary refill etc etc. 

#### Side note on examining the radial pulse

Assessing radio-radial delay and the collapsing pulse, whilst it may be required for OSCE examination, is not a common part of the standard cardiovascular exam. There are however, several cases in which you would want to assess for clinical signs. A collapsing pulse is a test for aortic regurgitation, but why? During aortic regurgitation, there is significant back flow through the aortic valve during diastole, which results in low diastolic pressure. This can be felt in high volume arterial pulses (such as the carotid or brachial) as a rapid rise and fall of the arterial pulse wave and is sometimes described as a "water-hammer pulse". It is named this way due to the phenomenon which occurs when a fluid in motion is forced to stop or change direction abruptly, resulting in a high-pressure shockwave that propogates. A water hammer was a Victorian toy in which a tube was half filled with fluid with the remainder being a vacuum and when inverted sounded like a hammer blow. It can occur when a pump suddenly shuts down and the flow reverses direction, just like a systolic pulse wave that drops suddenly to a low diastolic pressure. There are several pathological mechanisms which could result in a rapid descent of the arterial pressure wave such as patent ductus arteriosus, AV fistula and of course aortic regurgitation. Interestingly, water hammer can also occur in pipes where water slams into an closed valve. This could possibly explain the other causes of this pulse such as hyperdynamic states in liver cirrhosis. Back to the collapsing pulse. Raising the patient's arm swiftly upwards accentuates the reduction in diastolic pressure by using gravity to encourage blood to flow further back down the arm. This would accentuate the tapping pulse felt in the muscular bulk of the forearm. Therefore, when examining a patient with a reduced diastolic pressure, it may be beneficial to assess whether there is a collapsing pulse (to impress your consultant).
