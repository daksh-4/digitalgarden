This short story has innocent origins. 

I have been lulled into a false sense of security by my revision of the cardiovascular system. In my notes it is first in the alphabetical list of subspecialties (I usually skip Biochemistry when studying for exams) and thus the area which I have covered the most times. Combine this with the fact that a great proportion of patients have some cardiac comorbidities, lead me to believe that I am comfortable with the common cardiac presentations.
